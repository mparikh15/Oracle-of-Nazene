For boss fight, use a timed/ limited loop to mkae the fight work...
So character gets 3-4 chances to do the right thing otherwise the monster wins (unconcsious, go outside.)

for i in range
  options for fight
  option
  etc..

  die once the timer runs out. ---> After loop or in loop? Maybe run function on 5th iteration or whatever.
    counter++ on each unsuccessful attempt...
    counter == 5, die?
